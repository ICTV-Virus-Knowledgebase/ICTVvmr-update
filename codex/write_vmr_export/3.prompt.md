# fix isolate sort order from flat file

There is a problem with vmr_export.py: When reading the table 'vmr_export' from a flatfile source, the rows are incorrectly sorted in the source flat file. Add code to sort the rows of that table, specifically,  based on [ "Species Sort", "Isolate Sort"] where both columns are treated as containing integer numbers. Also make sure they are formatted in the output xlsx files as numeric, not text.
